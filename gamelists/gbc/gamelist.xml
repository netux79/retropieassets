The game, which stars Sir Arthur, a knight on a mission to rescue Princess Guinevere, travels players through six huge 2D scrolling levels rained with obstacles, enemies and other infuriating hazards. It was all too easy to meet one's doom at the near end of a stage as the difficulty level is unforgiving and have to start all over, but because of the clever coin-munching design and atmospheric presentation, the drag to keep playing never loosened. It's still regarded as one of the greats. The GBC version, released in 2000, is a direct port of the NES game.</desc>

		<name>Pokémon Puzzle Challenge</name>
		<desc>In a rising pit of colored blocks, it's your task to continuously eliminate these tiles by switching two tiles' positions on the horizontal row. When three or more tiles link up in a up/down or left/right fashion, they disappear. Gravity kicks in and settles the rest of the tiles into the bin ? this can cause a chain reaction to occur since other blocks of the same color can fall into place next to each other. It's up to you to continuously work the bin to wipe out tiles by making combination connections and chain reactions. That's the game in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that'll keep your fingers busy. In the game's Challenge mode, for example, you're up against a computer opponent and you'll have to make combos and chain reactions to send garbage blocks to his unseen screen -- but keep in mind your opponent's doing the same to you.</desc>

		<desc>Link’s latest challenge is set on the mysterious Koholint Island, a place where dreams and reality collide.  As a castaway, Link must find a way to escape from the island and return to his beloved homeland of Hyrule.  This will not be an easy task.

The island’s inhabitants have no knowledge of the outside world.  One creature, a talking owl, may know the solution to Link’s dilemma.  Link must first tackle eight dungeons full of treacherous monsters and tricky traps.  His goal: find the eight Instruments of the Sirens and awaken the omnipotent Wind Fish which rules the island.

		<name>V-Rally: Edition 99</name>
		<desc>Get all the bumps, jumps, thrills, and spills of off-road rally racing in your hands with V-RALLY EDITION '99 for the Game Boy Color. Choose between four real-world rally cars: Peugeot 306 Maxi, the Mitsubishi Lancer WRC, V-Rally Ford Escort WRC, and Subaru Impreza WRC. Then race on 40 courses in exotic locations like Indonesia, Safari, Corsica, New Zealand, Alps, United Kingdom, Greece, Argentina, Italy, and Sweden. The terrain of each track has an effect on your car's performance, and you must be careful because snow, dirt, and asphalt all react differently. In addition to the terrain, keep an eye out for obstacles like rocks, oil slicks, hills, and jumps. You can get all of the off-road action you could ever want with V-RALLY EDITION '99</desc>
