		<name>Cave Story</name>
		<desc>Arguably the most well-known indie game of all time, Cave Story features a completely original storyline wrapped with personality, mystery and hours of fast-paced fun. Cave Story is an action-adventure game from the critically acclaimed independent designer, Daisuke Amaya--or Pixel to his fans. Overflowing with unmatched charm and character, Cave Story takes you into a rare world where a curious race of innocent rabbit-like creatures, called Mimigas, run free.

You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village you discover that the once-carefree Mimigas are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. The Mimigas’ only hope rest squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name.

Run, jump, shoot, fly and explore your way through a massive action-adventure reminiscent of classic 8- and 16-bit games. Take control and learn the origins of this world’s power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga!</desc>

		<name>Zelda Mystery of Solarus DX</name>
		<desc>The Legend of Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX is set to be a direct sequel to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on the SNES, using the same graphics and game mechanisms. Zelda Mystery of Solarus DX is the first game made with the Solarus engine and in fact, Solarus was primarily designed for this game.

Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX is actually an enhanced remake of a first creation, Zelda: Mystery of Solarus. This first creation, developed with RPG Maker 2000, was released in 2002 and was only available in French. The DX project was unveiled on April 1st, 2008. Its objectives are to correct the many flaws of its predecessor: the battle system, the bosses, the use of items, etc.

However, that is hardly all of it as new graphical elements and musics will accompany you throughout the game. This Deluxe version will be the opportunity for players to relive the adventure in a brand new way, or to discover it for the first time if you’ve never played it before!</desc>

		<name>Zelda Return of the Hylian SE</name>
		<desc>Zelda Return of the Hylian Solarus Edition is a remake of the original Zelda Return of the Hylian, a short but pleasant fangame from Vincent Jouillat. The original game was developed in C++ and was released in 2009.

This new version is developed with the Solarus engine by Christopho, Mymy and Vincent Jouillat. While this is essentially the same game, a lot of details were improved thanks to the use of Solarus.

For users interested in creating games with Solarus, this project is also a great source of scripts. All items are scripted, including the hammer, the hookshot and the bow. There is also an elaborate dungeon room system using separators, with automatic restoration of enemies and pots.

The game is available in French, English, German and Spanish for now.</desc>

		<name>Doom</name>
		<desc>In Doom, a nameless space marine, gets punitively posted to Mars after assaulting a commanding officer, who ordered his unit to fire upon civilians. The Martian marine base acts as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation UAC, a multi-planetary conglomerate, which is performing secret experiments with teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos. Suddenly, one of these UAC experiments goes horribly wrong; computer systems on Phobos malfunction, Deimos disappears entirely and "something fragging evil" starts pouring out of the gateways, killing or possessing all UAC personnel! 
Responding to a frantic distress call from the overrun scientists, the Martian marine unit is quickly sent to Phobos to investigate, where you, the space marine, are left to guard the hangar with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside to discover their worst nightmare. As you advance further, terrifying screams echo through the vast halls, followed by a disturbing silence ... it seems, all your buddies are dead and you're all on your own now - fight back, exterminate every evil creature and get your ticket back home to earth!</desc>

Previously, the government had been experimenting with teleportation technology, and upon development of a working prototype called a "Slipgate", this enemy has compromised the human connection with their own teleportation system, using it to insert death squads into the "human" dimension, supposedly in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.</desc>
