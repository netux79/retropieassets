		<name>Ai Senshi Nicol</name>
		<desc>Nicol is a young genius who developed the technology to transport equipment across dimensions of space. News about this discovery spread throughout the galaxy, and now a menacing threat from a distant star system is determined to get their hands on that technology for their own purposes. To do that, a demon has kidnapped Nicol's girlfriend Stella, and is holding her captive until he gets the technology. She waits helplessly behind the demon's chamber, never giving up hope that her true love Nicol will come to save her.

As a result, Nicol decides to take on the entire invading alien race to save Stella, which means he must navigate a bunch of maze-like levels, collecting powerups and hitting switches to progress. Your goal in each stage is to collect three different diamonds to power your hovercraft to the next area, and many are, naturally, guarded by bosses.</desc>

		<name>Falsion</name>
		<desc>Humanity has colonized most planets in our galaxy, the Milky Way, and they now look towards expanding their reach by using an experimental travel technology called "Hyperzone Drive". However, a race of aliens who have already mastered that technology are currently invading planets at a quick pace, closing in on our solar system. The invaders attack humanity's colony on Pluto and conquer it with little resistance, since human civilization doesn't have the technology to defend itself.

The human organization responsible for the space program, the "United Space Force", decides to use the yet-untested "Hyperzone Drive" in order to send ships that will directly attack the armies of the invading aliens. However, the new technology proves hard to control, and only one of the ships manages to survive the trip: Falsion.</desc>

		<name>Super Mario Bros 2</name>
		<desc>Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.Â® 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if thatâs somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the gameâs secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just donât be surprised if sheâs in another castle!</desc>
