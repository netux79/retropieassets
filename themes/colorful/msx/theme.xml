			<text>MSX is a standardized home computer architecture Despite Microsoft's involvement, the MSX-based machines were seldom released in the United States, but were popular in other regions. Before the appearance and great success of Nintendo's Family Computer, MSX was the platform for which major Japanese game studios, such as Konami and Hudson Soft, produced video game titles.
